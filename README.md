# ðŸ’§ Water Allocation + Desalination Web App

An interactive **Streamlit web app** for modeling and visualizing **water allocation and desalination scenarios** across multiple treatment plants (Wylie, Leonard, and Tawakoni).  
The tool allows users to explore how desalination, mixing ratios, and plant capacities impact daily and yearly water distribution.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Adjustable **Projection Year** and **Peak Day Demand**
- Configurable **mixing ratios** (Lavon:Texoma, Bois dâ€™Arc:Texoma)
- **Pipe capacity limits** and **Bois dâ€™Arc average limit** (MGD)
- Interval-based rebalancing between Leonard and Wylie
- Multiple **Desalination Policies**:
  - No desalination
  - Desalination replacing Tawakoni water
  - Desalination replacing Wylie water
- **Ratio selection modes:**
  - Manual  
  - Capacity-based  
  - Optimized (maximize Texoma usage)
- Optional **daily plant caps** and curtailment reports
- Detailed **KPI summaries** and interactive plots
- Upload your own **SCADA data CSV** or use the included sample
